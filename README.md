**Enhance your applications by integrating Jetpack and applying modern app architectural concepts**

## What is this book about?
With Jetpack libraries, you can build and design high-quality, robust Android apps that have an improved architecture and work consistently across different versions and devices. This book will help you understand how Jetpack allows developers to follow best practices and architectural patterns when building Android apps while also eliminating boilerplate code.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Integrate popular Jetpack libraries such as Compose, ViewModel, Hilt, and Navigation into real Android apps with Kotlin
* Apply modern app architecture concepts such as MVVM, dependency injection, and clean architecture
* Explore Android libraries such as Retrofit, Coroutines, and Flow
* Integrate Compose with the rest of the Jetpack libraries or other popular Android libraries
* Work with other Jetpack libraries such as Paging and Room while integrating a real REST API that supports pagination
* Test Compose UI and the application logic through unit tests
